# DJI RoboMaster Plaintext SDK

After using a third-party platform to establish a connection with RoboMaster EP, users can perform more complex and interesting operations on the EP robot through the plaintext SDK. 

> The code here written for the DJI RoboMaster EP, connected via Wi-Fi Networking Mode.

## Requirements
### Install the SDK
Have the RoboMaster SDK installed, following [these instructions](https://robomaster-dev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python_sdk/installs.html)

### Programming Language
Ensure that the downloaded python.exe file is for 64-bit installation and the Python version is between **3.6.6 and 3.8.9**. Otherwise, you cannot use the Python SDK properly due to compatibility issues.

The code here was written in Python 3.8.8, which you can download from [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-388/). 

The code was written on a Windows 10 64-bit machine.

## Usage

After obtaining the IP address of the RoboMaster, one must update the IP address into the files. 

This can be done by searching for **[ip_address]** in the code, and replacing it with the IP address of the robot - keeping the inverted commas. 

## Description
`rm_get_robot_ip.py`

Sample Python code from DJI, fetches the IP address of the DJI RoboMaster EP. One can also find the IP address of the robot by looking for it under the settings page in the Robomaster application.

`rm_networking_connection_sdk.py`

Runs script to allow the user to enter the DJI RoboMaster's SDK mode to send control commands in a Command Line Interface (CLI). Enter `command` into the CLI. If the robot returns `ok;`, the connection has been established and the robot has entered SDK mode. Then, you can enter control commands to control the robot.

      >>> please input SDK cmd: command
      >>> ok!
      >>> please input SDK cmd: chassis move z 45
      >>> 

The diffent types of commands that can be sent can be found [here](https://robomaster-dev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/text_sdk/protocol_api.html)

`robot_connection.py`

This is a python module that supports a basic networking connection methods for connecting robots - it needs to be in the same folder as the other files, else the other files will not work. For more information, click [here](https://github.com/dji-sdk/RoboMaster-SDK/tree/master/examples/plaintext_sample_code/RoboMasterEP/connection/network).

`rm_livestream.py`

Fetches the video stream from the DJI RoboMaster EP and displays it on screen - **this code does NOT fetch the audio stream**. 

The [decoders](https://github.com/dji-sdk/RoboMaster-SDK/tree/master/examples/plaintext_sample_code/RoboMasterEP/stream/decoder) for video and audio strams need to be installed, and can be done by following the documentation.
